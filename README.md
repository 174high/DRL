* dot test 

**Tetris**
<br>Original tetris game code is from [invent with pygame](http://inventwithpython.com/pygame)
<br>Wrapped version of game code is from [github of asrivat1](https://github.com/asrivat1/DeepLearningVideoGames)

**Dot**
<br>I made this game to evaluate my DQN code. 
<br>Rule is very simple. Blue square is agent, Red square is enemy(- reward), Green diamond is food(+ reward)
<br>So blue square needs to evade red square and get the green diamond. 
<br>You can change the difficulty and maps in the code. 

**Dot mini**
<br> This is simple version of Dot.
